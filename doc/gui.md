# GUI

**The GUI for this game is inspired by the game Wave Collector in** [**raylib**](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib)**.**

### Library

raylib library is used for making this GUI. Using this library ease the pain of dependency however it itself must be installed externally.

### Screens

![GUI screens](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%285%29.png)

These 5 screens have been used to make this GUI. Each will be redirected to another one when needed. 

Screens do not follow a circle, once the `screen_ending` screen would appear, the game is finished and you have to reopen the game for playing another round.

### Scale Function

As you know from VMG section, in order to make the Generated graph beautiful, we also input the pixel position of each vertex. However that's not enough.

Most of the times the pixel location generated by VGM are very close to each other hence the graph is so tiny and not aesthetically pleasurable.

By the help of linear [scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaling_%28geometry%29) transformation in Euclidean geometry, there is a `expandGraph()` function to handle this issue.
